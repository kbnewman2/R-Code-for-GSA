R Code for carrying out several types of Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) on deterministic simulators. GSA methods include Morris Elementary Effects, Sobol' sensitivities, VARS-TO variogram method, and several regression-based methods. Currently only one simulator, GR6J is used. User needs to create a folder, say GR6J, then 3 subfolders: R Code, Data, and Output.  Then in GR6J/Output, create 6 more subfolders: 1_Morris, 2_Sobol, 3_VARS.TO, 4_Regression, 5_RegTree_RF, 6_GPReg.  Put the R Code in he R Code Folder and he Excel data file, Coull_GR6J_R.xlsx, in the Data Folder. 

Then edit the lines in the two R code files, GR6J_GSA_generate.Rmd (~ line 60) and GR6J_GSA_evaluate.Rmd (~ line 43), where the object root has your GR6J folder location.  To run Morris method, simply knit GR6J_GSA_generate.Rmd first, then knit GR6J_GSA_evaluate.Rmd.  Results will appear in the Output subfolder.
